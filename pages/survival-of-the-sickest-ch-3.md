I've recently started reading *[Dr. Sharon Moalem](http://sharonmoalem.com/)*'s book **"[Survival of the Sickest](http://www.survivalofthesickestthebook.com/): A Medical Maverick Discovers Why We Need Disease"**. The book is a great mixture of medical science, evolutionary biology, history and stroy telling. Each chapter focuses on a certain disease or health-issue (or a few that are somehow connected) and presents an evolutionary explanation for why this disease is so common. The author describes the pleiotropy[^pleiotropy] of these diseases and explains how it might lead to their high prevalence.

I'd like to give a short summary of the third chapter of the book, which focuses on the connection between vitamin D, folic acid, cholesterol and UV exposure - all known for their involvement in multiple diseases and syndromes. I will only give a summary of the chapter, but it is still a spoiler and I encourage you to just stop reading this blog and go read the actual book.

## The Cholesterol Also Rises - Chapter III

### ** SPOILER STARTS HERE! **

The figure above gives a summary of the effects discussed in the chapter. In the heart of the interaction network, exposure to UVB from direct sunlight both converts cholesterol to vitamin D and destroys folic acid. This effect of sunlight combines three health issues - high cholesterol causes heart disease (and other problems), while vitamin D and folic acid deficiencies cause, for example, rickets and osteoperosis (vitamin D) and birth defects (folic acid). 

This leads to balancing selection on skin color...
