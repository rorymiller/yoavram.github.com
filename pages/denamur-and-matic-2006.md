This is a summary of [Denamur and Matic [-@Denamur2006]](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05150.x/abstract).

1. Deleterious mutations are 100,000-fold more frequent than beneficial mutations in *E. coli*.
2. Mutators have been found in various species of bacteria if frequencies of 0.1-60% (1% strong mutators, 10-30% weak mutators, [@Matic1997; @Baquero2004]. 
1. These frequencies are higher than expected under a **mutation-selection balance** (MSB) - Boe *et al.* [-@Boe2000] estimated it to be 3e-5.
3. Mutator alleles are mainly mutants in the **mismatch repair (MMR) system**  (*mutS*, *mutL*, see the article for more information on the operation of these genes and the MMR system).
4. Rate increases by these MMR mutants: **100-fold increase in transitions, 1,000-fold increase in frameshifts and 10-1,000-fold increase in chromosomal rearrangements**.
5. MMR mutatns arise by different mutation types. The rate of non-mutator to mutator was estimated by Boe *et al.* [-@Boe2000] to be 5e-6 per generation.
6. What can increase the frequency of MMR mutants above the expected in MSB?
    - **Higher replication  rates** due to the absence of the metabolic load imposed by DNA repair enzymes[^1]
    - **Higher adaptation rate** due to the faster generation of beneficial mutations[^2]
7. **The first hypothesis was rejected**: Several studies found that **mutators are advanageous only when** the ratio of mutator to non-mutator is such that **beneficial mutations are more likely to be generated by mutators** than by non-mutators.
8. This effect is stonger in bacteria because recombination rates are low and mutators are not frequently separated from the beneficial mutations they generate.
9. Although mutators can reach high frequencies quickly in adaptive evolution, they accumulate deleterious mutations and decline in frequency in a constant environment.
10. **Migration** to new environments can change a beneficial mutation to neutral or deleterious.
11. Mutators are more vulnerable to *Muller's ratchet* due to faster accumulation of deleterious mutations [@Funchain2000].
12. Beneficial mutations can move to non-mutator background by horizontal gene transfer or back/compensatory mutation at the mutator locus.
13. **Local mutators** - DNA sequences that induce high mutation rates in their neighborhoods - were found in virulent loci.
12. There are over 20 loci associated with mutator phenotypes, probably with different direct effects on mutation rate and fitness and with different pleiotropic effects - for example, *mutT* increases the mutation and adaptation rate but also increases transcriptional error rate [@Taddei1997a].
13. MMR mutants are special because they also **increase recombination rates** which can help in adaptation [@Funchain2001]. High recombination rates can also help to restore non-mutator alleles after adaptation is complete[^3].
14. Most mutators were found in **pathogenic bacteria**.
15. Some mutators were correlated in natural populations with **antibiotic resistance**, however not strong mutators: the latter are probably counter-selected after adaptation and are therefore not found in natural population [@Taddei1997].
