abstract = {We examine the potential beneficial effects of the expanded access to environmental DNA offered by mutators on the adaptive potential of bacterial populations. Using parameters from published studies of recombination in E. coli, we find that the presence of mutators has the potential to greatly enhance bacterial population adaptation when compared to populations without mutators. In one specific example, for which three specific amino acid substitutions are required for adaptation to occur in a 300-amino-acid protein, we found a 3500-fold increase in the rate of adaptation. The probability of a beneficial acquisition decreased if more amino acid changes, or integration of longer DNA fragments, were required for adaptation. The model also predicts that mutators are more likely than nonmutator phenotypes to acquire genetic variability from a more diverged set of donor bacteria. Bacterial populations harboring mutators in a sequence heterogeneous environment are predicted to acquire most of their DNA conferring adaptation in the range of 13-30\% divergence, whereas nonmutator phenotypes become adapted after recombining with more homogeneous sequences of 7-21\% divergence. We conclude that mutators can accelerate bacterial adaptation when desired genetic variability is present within DNA fragments of up to [\~{}]30\% divergence.

Bacterial mismatch repair (MMR) deficient mutants, exhibiting high mutation and homologous recombination rates, are frequently found in natural populations. Therefore, we have explored the possibility that MMR deficiency emerging in nature has left some "imprint" in the sequence of bacterial genomes. Comparative molecular phylogeny of MMR genes from natural Escherichia coli isolates shows that, compared to housekeeping genes, individual functional MMR genes exhibit high sequence mosaicism derived from diverse phylogenetic lineages. This apparent horizontal gene transfer correlates with hyperrecombination phenotype of MMR-deficient mutators. The sequence mosaicism of MMR genes may be a hallmark of a mechanism of adaptive evolution that involves modulation of mutation and recombination rates by recurrent losses and reacquisitions of MMR gene functions.},

abstract = {The adaptive value of recombination remains something of a puzzle. One of the basic problems is that recombination not only creates new and advantageous genetic combinations, but also breaks down existing good ones. A negative correlation between the fitness of an individual and its recombination rate would result in prolonged integrity of fitter genetic combinations while enabling less fit ones to produce new combinations. Such a correlation could be mediated by various factors, including stress responses, age, or direct DNA damage. For haploid population models, we show that an allele for such fitness-associated recombination (FAR) can spread both in asexual populations and in populations reproducing sexually at any uniform recombination rate. FAR also carries an advantage for the population as a whole, resulting in a higher average fitness at mutation-selection balance. These results are demonstrated in populations adapting to new environments as well as in well-adapted populations coping with deleterious mutations. Current experimental results providing evidence for the existence of FAR in nature are discussed.},

The source of transforming DNA, the amount of DNA taken up by each transforming cell, and the relationship between number of mutations and cell viability (the fitness function) are important factors. When the DNA source is living cells, transformation resembles meiotic sex. When the DNA source is cells killed by selection against mutations, transformation increases the average number of mutations per genome but can nevertheless increase the mean fitness of the population at equilibrium. In a model of regulated transformation, in which the most fit cells of a transforming population do not transform, transforming populations are always fitter at equilibrium than asexual populations.

@article{Christiansen1998,
abstract = {R.A. Fisher and H.J. Muller argued in the 1930s that a major evolutionary advantage of recombination is that it allows favorable mutations to be combined within an individual even when they first appear in different individuals. This effect is evaluated in a two-locus, two-allele model by calculating the average waiting time until a new genotypic combination first appears in a haploid population. Three approximations are developed and compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the Wright-Fisher process of random genetic drift in a finite population. First, a crude method, based on the deterministic accumulation of single mutants, produces a waiting time of 1/square root of N mu(2) with no recombination and [formula: see text] with recombination between the two loci, where mu is the mutation rate, N is the haploid population size, and R is the recombination rate. Second, the waiting time is calculated as the expected value of a heterogeneous geometric distribution obtained from a branching process approximation. This gives accurate estimates for small values of N mu large. The estimates for small values of N mu are considerably lower than the simulated values. Finally, diffusion analysis of the Wright-Fisher process provides accurate estimates for N mu small, and the time scales of the diffusion process show a difference between R = 0 and for R >> 0 of the same order of magnitude as seen in the deterministic analysis. In the absence of recombination, accurate approximations to the waiting time are obtained by using the branching process for high N mu and the diffusion approximation for low N mu. For low N mu the waiting time is well approximated by 1/the square root of 8N2 mu(3). With R >> 0, the following dependence on N mu is observed: For N mu > 1 the waiting time is virtually independent of recombination and is well described by the branching process approximation. For N mu approximately equal to 1 the waiting time is well described by a simplified diffusion approximation that assumes symmetry in the frequencies of single mutants. For N mu << 1 the waiting time is well described by the diffusion approximation allowing asymmetry in the frequencies of single mutants. Recombination lowers the waiting time until a new genotypic combination first appears, but the effect is small compared to that of the mutation rate and population size. For large N mu, recombination has a negligible effect, and its effect is strongest for small N mu, in which case the waiting time approaches a fixed fraction of the waiting time for R = 0. Free recombination lowers the waiting time to about 45\% of the waiting time for absolute linkage for small N mu. Selection has little effect on the importance of recombination in general.},

abstract = {Horizontal gene transfermediated by transformation is of central importance in bacterial evolution. However, numerous questions remain about themaintenance of processes that underlie transformation. Most hypotheses for the benefits of transformation focus on what bacteria might do with DNA, but ignore the important fact that transformation is subsumed within the broader process of competence. Accordingly, the apparent benefits of transformation might rely less on recombination than on other potential benefits associatedwith the broader suite of traits regulated by competence.We examined the importance of this distinction in the naturally competent species Streptococcus pneumoniae, focusing specifically on predictions of the DNA-for-repair hypothesis.We confirm earlier results in other naturally competent species that transformation protects against DNA-damaging stress. In addition, we show that the stress-protection extends to non-DNA-damaging stress. More important, we find that for some forms of stress transformation is not required for cells to benefit from the induction of competence. This rejects the narrowly defined DNA-for- repair hypotheses and provides the first support for Claverys’ hypothesis that competence, but not necessarily transformation, may act as a general process to relieve stress. Our results highlight the need to distinguish benefits of transformation frombroader benefits of competence that do not rely on DNA uptake and recombination.},

@article{Levin2009,
abstract = {In bacteria, recombination is a rare event, not a part of the reproductive process. Nevertheless, recombination -- broadly defined to include the acquisition of genes from external sources, i.e., horizontal gene transfer (HGT) -- plays a central role as a source of variation for adaptive evolution in many species of bacteria. Much of niche expansion, resistance to antibiotics and other environmental stresses, virulence, and other characteristics that make bacteria interesting and problematic, is achieved through the expression of genes and genetic elements obtained from other populations of bacteria of the same and different species, as well as from eukaryotes and archaea. While recombination of homologous genes among members of the same species has played a central role in the development of the genetics and molecular biology of bacteria, the contribution of homologous gene recombination (HGR) to bacterial evolution is not at all clear. Also, not so clear are the selective pressures responsible for the evolution and maintenance of transformation, the only bacteria-encoded form of HGR. Using a semi-stochastic simulation of mutation, recombination, and selection within bacterial populations and competition between populations, we explore (1) the contribution of HGR to the rate of adaptive evolution in these populations and (2) the conditions under which HGR will provide a bacterial population a selective advantage over non-recombining or more slowly recombining populations. The results of our simulation indicate that, under broad conditions: (1) HGR occurring at rates in the range anticipated for bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacillus subtilis will accelerate the rate at which a population adapts to environmental conditions; (2) once established in a population, selection for this capacity to increase rates of adaptive evolution can maintain bacteria-encoded mechanisms of recombination and prevent invasion of non-recombining populations, even when recombination engenders a modest fitness cost; and (3) because of the density- and frequency-dependent nature of HGR in bacteria, this capacity to increase rates of adaptive evolution is not sufficient as a selective force to provide a recombining population a selective advantage when it is rare. Under realistic conditions, homologous gene recombination will increase the rate of adaptive evolution in bacterial populations and, once established, selection for higher rates of evolution will promote the maintenance of bacteria-encoded mechanisms for HGR. On the other hand, increasing rates of adaptive evolution by HGR is unlikely to be the sole or even a dominant selective pressure responsible for the original evolution of transformation.},

Several isolates had acquired small mosaic segments from other H. pylori or point mutations. The maximal mutation rate, the import size, and the frequency of recombination were calculated by using a Bayesian model. The calculations indicate that the last common ancestor of H. pylori existed at least 2,500-11,000 years ago. Imported mosaics have a median size of 417 bp, much smaller than for other bacteria, and recombination occurs frequently (60 imports spanning 25,000 bp per genome per year). Thus, the panmictic population structure of H. pylori results from very frequent recombination during mixed colonization by unrelated strains.},

The common thread among many of these disciplines is that sex acts like a coarse filter, weeding out major changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements (that are almost always deleterious), but letting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral), flow through the sexual sieve. Sex acts as a constraint on genomic and epigenetic variation, thereby limiting adaptive evolution. The diverse reasons for sex reducing genetic variation (especially at the genome level) and slowing down evolution may provide a sufficient benefit to offset the famed costs of sex.},

abstract = {The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

abstract = {Development normally occurs similarly in all individuals within an isogenic population, but mutations often affect the fates of individual organisms differently. This phenomenon, known as partial penetrance, has been observed in diverse developmental systems. However, it remains unclear how the underlying genetic network specifies the set of possible alternative fates and how the relative frequencies of these fates evolve. Here we identify a stochastic cell fate determination process that operates in Bacillus subtilis sporulation mutants and show how it allows genetic control of the penetrance of multiple fates. Mutations in an intercompartmental signalling process generate a set of discrete alternative fates not observed in wild-type cells, including rare formation of two viable 'twin' spores, rather than one within a single cell. By genetically modulating chromosome replication and septation, we can systematically tune the penetrance of each mutant fate. Furthermore, signalling and replication perturbations synergize to significantly increase the penetrance of twin sporulation. These results suggest a potential pathway for developmental evolution between monosporulation and twin sporulation through states of intermediate twin penetrance. Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy of twin sporulation in wild-type Clostridium oceanicum shows a strong resemblance to twin sporulation in these B. subtilis mutants. Together the results suggest that noise can facilitate developmental evolution by enabling the initial expression of discrete morphological traits at low penetrance, and allowing their stabilization by gradual adjustment of genetic parameters.},

While such natural transformation systems may provide many of the same benefits that sexual reproduction provides eukaryotes, there are important differences that critically alter the consequences, especially when recombination's main benefit is reducing the mutation load. Here, analytical and numerical methods are used to study the selection of transformation genes in populations undergoing deleterious mutation. Selection for transformability depends on the shape of the fitness function against mutation. If the fitness function is linear, then transformation would be selectively neutral were it not for the possibility that transforming cells may take up DNA that converts them into nontransformable cells. If the selection includes strong positive (synergistic) epistasis, then transformation can be advantageous in spite of this risk. The effect of low quality DNA (from selectively killed cells) on selection is then studied analytically and found to impose an additional cost. The limited data available for real bacterial populations suggest that the conditions necessary for the evolution of transformation are unlikely to be met, and thus that DNA uptake may have some function other than recombination of deleterious mutations.},

abstract = {Mutations in the DNA mismatch repair system increase mutation and recombination. They may thereby promote the genetic divergence that underlies speciation, after which the reacquisition of a functional repair system may sustain that divergence by creating a barrier to recombination. We tested several lines of Escherichia coli, derived from a common ancestor and evolved for 20,000 generations, for their recombination ability. Some lines, but not others, had become mismatch repair-defective mutators during experimental evolution, providing different opportunities for DNA sequence divergence. We knocked out the repair system in lines that had retained this function, and we restored function to those lines that had become defective. We then estimated recombination rates in various crosses between these repair-deficient and -proficient strains. The effect of the mismatch repair system on recombination was greatest in those lines that had evolved nonfunctional repair, indicating they had undergone more sequence divergence and, consequently, were more sensitive to the recombination-inhibiting effect of a functional repair system. These results demonstrate the establishment of an incipient genetic barrier between formerly identical lines, and they support a model in which the mismatch repair system can influence speciation dynamics through its simultaneous effects on mutation and recombination.},

abstract = {Adaptive (or stationary-phase) mutation is a group of phenomena in which mutations appear to occur more often when selected than when not. They may represent cellular responses to the environment in which the genome is altered to allow survival. The best-characterized assay system and mechanism is reversion of a lac allele on an F' sex plasmid in Escherichia coli, in which the stationary-phase mutability requires homologous recombination functions. A key issue has concerned whether the recombination-dependent mutation mechanism is F' specific or is general. Hypermutation of chromosomal genes occurs in association with adaptive Lac(+) mutation. Here we present evidence that the chromosomal hypermutation is promoted by recombination. Hyperrecombinagenic recD cells show elevated chromosomal hypermutation. Further, recG mutation, which promotes accumulation of recombination intermediates proposed to prime replication and mutation, also stimulates chromosomal hypermutation. The coincident mutations at lac (on the F') and chromosomal genes behave as independent events, whereas coincident mutations at lac and other F-linked sites do not. This implies that transient covalent linkage of F' and chromosomal DNA (Hfr formation) does not underlie chromosomal mutation. The data suggest that recombinational stationary-phase mutation occurs in the bacterial chromosome and thus can be a general strategy for programmed genetic change.},

abstract = {When new advantageous alleles arise and spread within a population, deleterious alleles at neighboring loci can hitchhike alongside them and spread to fixation in areas of low recombination, introducing a fixed mutation load. We use branching processes and diffusion equations to calculate the probability that a deleterious allele hitchhikes and fixes alongside an advantageous mutant. As expected, the probability of fixation of a deleterious hitchhiker rises with the selective advantage of the sweeping allele and declines with the selective disadvantage of the deleterious hitchhiker. We then use computer simulations of a genome with an infinite number of loci to investigate the increase in load after an advantageous mutant is introduced. We show that the appearance of advantageous alleles on genetic backgrounds loaded with deleterious alleles has two potential effects: it can fix deleterious alleles, and it can facilitate the persistence of recombinant lineages that happen to occur. The latter is expected to reduce the signals of selection in the surrounding region. We consider these results in light of human genetic data to infer how likely it is that such deleterious hitchhikers have occurred in our recent evolutionary past.},

@article{Gessler2000,
abstract = {The classical understanding of recombination is that in large asexual populations with multiplicative fitness, linkage disequilibrium is negligible, and thus there is no selective agent driving an allele for recombination. This has led researchers to recognize the importance of synergistic epistatic selection in generating negative linkage disequilibrium that thereby renders an advantage to recombination. Yet data on such selection is equivocal, and various works have shown that synergistic epistasis per se, when left unquantified in its magnitude or operation, is not sufficient to drive the evolution of recombination. Here we show that neither it, nor any mechanism generating negative linkage disequilibrium among fitness-related loci, is necessary. We demonstrate that a neutral gene for recombination can increase in frequency in a large population under a low mutation rate and strict multiplicative fitness. We work in a parameter range where individuals have, on average, less than one mutation each, yet recombination can still evolve. We demonstrate this in two ways: first, by examining the consequences of recombination correlated with misrepaired DNA damage and, second, by increasing the probability of recombination with declining fitness. Interestingly, the allele spreads without repairing even a single DNA mutation.

It is believed that horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in shaping bacterial genomes and is also believed to be responsible for the relatively rapid dissemination and acquisition of new, adaptive traits across bacterial strains. Despite the importance of horizontal gene transfer as a major source of genetic variation, the bulk of research on theoretical evolutionary dynamics and population genetics has focused on point mutations (sometimes coupled with gene duplication events) as the main engine of genomic change. Here, we seek to specifically model HGT processes in bacterial cells, by developing a mathematical model describing the influence that conjugation-mediated HGT has on the mutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of unicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection balance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of antibiotic, to which the population must become resistant to survive. We find that HGT has a nontrivial effect on the mean fitness of the population. However, one of the central results that emerge from our analysis is that, at mutation-selection balance, conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly deleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population. Therefore, we conclude that HGT does not confer a selection advantage in static environments. Rather, its advantage must lie in its ability to promote faster adaptation in dynamic environments, an interpretation that is consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by environmental stresses on a population.},

The induction by barley stripe mosaic virus of an inherited effect may mean that the virus has a non-cell-autonomous influence on genome stability. Infection with Peronospora parasitica results in an increase in the frequency of somatic recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, it is unclear whether effects on recombination require the presence of the pathogen or represent a systemic plant response. It is also not clear whether the changes in the frequency of somatic recombination can be inherited. Here we report a threefold increase in homologous recombination frequency in both infected and non-infected tissue of tobacco plants infected with either tobacco mosaic virus or oilseed rape mosaic virus. These results indicate the existence of a systemic recombination signal that also results in an increased frequency of meiotic and/or inherited late somatic recombination.},

Here, we test whether the presence of a deleterious allele on one autosome affects recombination on another autosome. We find that deleterious alleles not only alter the rate but also the pattern of recombination. However, there is little support that different deleterious alleles affect recombination in a consistent manner. Because we have detailed information on individual females across their lifetimes, we are able to examine how recombination patterns change with age and find that these patterns are also affected by the presence of deleterious alleles.

abstract = {Subinhibitory concentrations of some antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, have been reported to stimulate mutation and, consequently, bacterial adaptation to different stresses, including antibiotic pressure. In Escherichia coli, this stimulation is mediated by alternative DNA polymerases induced via the SOS response. Sublethal concentrations of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin have been shown to stimulate recombination between divergent sequences in E. coli. However, the effect of ciprofloxacin on recombination between homologous sequences and its SOS dependence have not been studied. Moreover, the possible effects of other antibiotics on homologous recombination remain untested. The aim of this work was to study the effects of sublethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin and 10 additional antibiotics, including different molecular families with different molecular targets, on the rate of homologous recombination of DNA in E. coli. The antibiotics tested were ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, rifampin (rifampicin), trimethoprim, fosfomycin, and colistin. Our results indicate that only ciprofloxacin consistently stimulates the intrachromosomal recombinogenic capability of homologous sequences in E. coli. The ciprofloxacin-based stimulation occurs at concentrations and times that apparently do not dramatically compromise the viability of the whole population, and it is dependent on RecA and partially dependent on SOS induction. One of the main findings of this work is that, apart from quinolone antibiotics, none of the most used antibiotics, including trimethoprim (a known inducer of the SOS response), has a clear side effect on homologous recombination in E. coli. In addition to the already described effects of some antibiotics on mutagenicity, DNA transfer, and genetic transformability in naturally competent species, the effect of increasing intrachromosomal recombination of homologous DNA sequences can be uniquely ascribed to fluoroquinolones, at least for E. coli.},

abstract = {An accurate estimate of the extent of recombination is important whenever phylogenetic methods are applied to potentially recombining nucleotide sequences. Here, data sets from viruses, bacteria, and mitochondria were ex- amined for deviations from clonality using a new approach for detecting and measuring recombination. The apparent rate heterogeneity (ARH) among sites in a sequence alignment can be inflated as an artifact of recombination. However, the composition of polymorphic sites will differ in a data set with recombination-generated ARH versus a clonal data set that exhibits the equivalent degree of rate heterogeneity. This is because recombinant data sets, encompassing regions of conflicting phylogenetic history, tend to yield ‘‘starlike’’ trees that are superficially similar to those inferred from clonal data sets with weak phylogenetic signal throughout. Specifically, a recombinant data set will be unexpectedly rich in conflicting phylogenetic information compared with clonally generated data sets supporting the same tree shape. Its value of q—defined as the proportion of two-state parsimony-informative sites to all polymorphic sites—will be greater than that expected for nonrecombinant data. The method proposed here, the informative-sites test, compares the value of q against a null distribution of values found using Monte Carlo– simulated data evolved under the null hypothesis of clonality. A significant excess of q indicates that the assumption of clonality is not valid and hence that the ARH in the data is at least partly an artifact of recombination. Investi- gations of the procedure using simulated sequences indicated that it can successfully detect and measure recombi- nation and that it is unlikely to produce ‘‘false positives.’’ Simulations also showed that for recombinant data, naı ¨ve use of maximum-likelihood models incorporating rate heterogeneity can lead to overestimation of the time to the most recent common ancestor.

abstract = {The concept of evolvability is controversial. To some, it is simply a measure of the standing genetic variation in a population and can be captured by the narrow-sense heritability (h2). To others, evolvability refers to the capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation. Many scientists, including Darwin, have argued that environmental variation can generate heritable phenotypic variation. However, their theories have been difficult to test. Recent theory on the evolution of sex and recombination provides a much simpler framework for evaluating evolv- ability. It shows that modifiers of recombination can increase in prevalence whenever low fitness individuals produce proportionately more recombinant offspring. Be- cause recombination can generate heritable variation, stress- induced recombination might be a plausible mechanism of evolvability if populations exhibit a negative relationship between fitness and recombination. Here we use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test for this relationship. We exposed females to mating stress, heat shock or cold shock and measured the temporary changes that occurred in reproductive output and the rate of chromosomal recombi- nation. We found that each stress treatment increased the},

To study the evolution of plastic recombination, we develop a modifier model using the same theoretical framework used to study conventional (nonplastic) modifiers, thus allowing direct comparison. We examine the evolution of plastic recombination in both haploid and diploid systems. In haploids, a plastic modifier spreads by forming associations with selectively favored alleles. Relative to nonplastic effects, selection on the plastic effects of a modifier is both much stronger and less sensitive to the specifics of the selection regime (e.g., epistasis). In contrast, the evolution of plastic recombination in diploids is much more restricted. Selection on plasticity requires the ability to detect DNA damage or cis-trans effects as may occur through maternal effects on fitness.},

abstract = {The porB locus codes for the major outer membrane protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Alleles of this locus have been assigned to two homology groups based on close sequence and immunological relationships and are designated as either PIA or PIB. Several population parameters were estimated and compared among these two groups using a data set of 22 PIA sequences and 91 PIB sequences obtained from diverse geographic localities and from time periods spanning approximately 50 years. Recombination appears to be extensive in the porB gene. While the recombination rates are similar for the PIA and PIB sequences, the relative contribution of recombination to genetic diversity is higher for the PIA sequences. Alleles belonging to the PIB group show greater genetic diversity than do those in the PIA group. Although phylogenetic analysis did not reveal temporal or geographic clustering of sequences, estimates of gene flow and the fixation index suggested that PIB sequences exhibit population substruc- ture based on geographic locality. Selection acts in these homology groups in a different way. While positive Darwinian selection is the dominant force driving the evolution of the PIA sequences, purifying selection operates also on the PIB sequences. These differences may be attributable to the greater propensity of PIA strains, as compared with PIB strains, to cause disseminated gonococcal infection, which would expose the former to intense selection pressure from the host immune system. The molecular evolution of Neisseria gonorrhoeae seems to be driven by the simultaneous action of selection and recombination, but under different rates and selection pressures for the PIA and PIB homology groups},

abstract = {Interspecies genetic exchange is an important evolutionary mechanism in bacteria. It allows rapid acquisition of novel functions by transmission of adaptive genes between related species. However, the frequency of homologous recombination between bacterial species decreases sharply with the extent of DNA sequence divergence between the donor and the recipient. In Bacillus and Escherichia, this sexual isolation has been shown to be an exponential function of sequence divergence. Here we demonstrate that sexual isolation in transformation between Streptococcus pneumoniae recipient strains and donor DNA from related strains and species follows the described exponential relationship. We show that the Hex mismatch repair system poses a significant barrier to recombination over the entire range of sequence divergence (0.6 to 27\%) investigated. Although mismatch repair becomes partially saturated, it is responsible for 34\% of the observed sexual isolation. This is greater than the role of mismatch repair in Bacillus but less than that in Escherichia. The remaining non-Hex-mediated barrier to recombination can be provided by a variety of mechanisms. We discuss the possible additional mechanisms of sexual isolation, in view of earlier findings from Bacillus, Escherichia, and Streptococcus.},

abstract = {Contrary to what was thought previously, bacteria seem to be, not merely spectators to their own evolution, but, through a variety of mechanisms, able to increase the rate at which mutations occur and, consequently, to increase their chances of becoming resistant to antibiotics. Laboratory studies and mathematical models suggest that, under stressful conditions, such as antibiotic challenge, selective pressure favors mutator strains of bacteria over nonmutator strains. These hypermutable strains have been found in natural bacterial populations at higher frequencies than expected. The presence of mutator strains in the clinical setting may indicate an enhanced risk of acquiring antibiotic resistance through mutational and recombinational events. In addition, some antibiotics are inducers of mechanisms that transiently increase the mutation rate, and thus probably act, not only as mere selectors of antibiotic resistant clones, but also as resistance-promoters.},

abstract = {Natural selection can adjust the rate of mutation in a population by acting on allelic variation affecting processes of DNA replication and repair. Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this "cost of fidelity" is likely only under special circumstances.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory suggests that low mutation rates should favor the persistence of asexuals. Additionally, given the observation that most nonneutral mutations are deleterious, asexuality may strengthen selection for reduced mutation rates. This reciprocal relationship raises the possibility of a positive feedback loop between sex and mutation rate. We explored the consequences of this evolutionary feedback with an individual-based model in which a sexual population is continually challenged by the introduction of asexual clones. We found that asexuals were more likely to spread in a population when mutation rates were able to evolve relative to a model in which mutation rates were held constant. In fact, under evolving mutation rates, asexuals were able to spread to fixation even when sexuals faced no cost of sex whatsoever. The added success of asexuals was the result of their ability to evolve lower mutation rates and thereby slow the process of mutation accumulation that otherwise limited their spread. Given the existence of ample mutation rate variation in natural populations, our findings show that the evolutionary feedback between sex and mutation rate may intensify the "paradox of sex," supporting the argument that deleterious mutation accumulation alone is likely insufficient to overcome the reproductive advantage of asexual competitors in the short term.},

2. invasion of asexuals to sexuals by mutation at the reproductive mode locus. after an MSB. 2.b invasion without evolution of mutation rate - mut rate constant at the MSB value
invasions - 30 replicates, 1000 generations.
        
results:
1. sexuals evolve higher mutation rates, and the dynamics match Dawson's theory
2. if asexual mutation rate evolved it greatly increaed their success. this is because their optimal fitness is with a lower mutation rate (1) and the starting point is the sexuals optimal mutation rate
        
problems:
this is true for a MSB. if adaptation is required, then mutator alleles will be selected for much more effectively in asexuals do to linkage disequilibrium (drives mutation rate up in asexuals) and to fisher muller effect (recombination and mutation are competing adaptive strategies).},

Despite the cost due to a heavy deleterious mutation load, mutator alleles, which increase the mutation rate, can spread in asexual populations during adaptation because they remain associated with the rare favorable mutations they generate. This indirect selection for a genetic system generating diversity (second-order selection) is expected to be highly sensitive to changes in the dynamics of adaptation. Here we show by a simulation approach that even rare genetic exchanges, such as bacterial conjugation or transformation, can dramatically reduce the selection of mutators. Moreover, drift or competition between the processes of mutation and recombination in the course of adaptation reveal how second-order selection is unable to optimize the rate of generation of novelty.},
